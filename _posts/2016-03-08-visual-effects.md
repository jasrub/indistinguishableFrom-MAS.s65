<h6>Video Recipe:</h6>

<b>Ingredients:</b>
<ul>
	<li>Camera</li>
	<li>Tripod (very important!)</li>
	<li> cutting board, knife, fruits/vegetables</li>
	<li> Printed image of a strawberry </li>
	<li> 2 helpful friends</li>
	<li> <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/premiere.html">Adobe Primier Pro</a></li>
</ul>

<b>How it's done:</b>
<ul>
	<li>Set the camera on the tripod and make sure it's not moving.</li>
	<li>One of the helpful friends is responsible for clicking the record/pause button on the camera.</li>
	<li>Start recording, when a magic need to happen, tell the friend to pause the camera, while the other helpful friend is responsible for replacing the objects in the frame.</li>
	<li>It is very important that someone else will swap the changing objects, so you move your hands as little as possible between each shot.</li>
	<li>After all the recordings are done, choose you favourite editing software to cut, connect and insert audio.</li>
	<li>I used Adobe Premier, and there are many tutorials for that online.</li>
	<li>I also speeded most video parts to play at X2 speed, and added music I found on the <a href="http://freemusicarchive.org/curator/video">free music archive</a>.</li>
	<li>To hide the video cuts, which were very noticeable, I added the "ding" sound on each switch.</li>
	<li>I changed the strawberries color using the "paint bucket" effect in Premiere, <a href="http://disposablefilm.com/Tutorial-2.html">described here</a></li>
</ul>

Bon appetit!
