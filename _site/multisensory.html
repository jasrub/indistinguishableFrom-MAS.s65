				<section>
					<p>I’ve been very interested in food in the past few weeks, and also in the human perception of food and taste.
I think food that is done and served well could definitely feel like magic.</p>

<p>So, for this week I wanted to try and do a gustatory (taste) illusion.
Research regarding our perception of taste as already been done before, and it is extremely interesting!
One famous experiment is the <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/butchers-tongue-illusion">Fake tongue illusion</a>
Other very interesting work has been done by the british chef Heston Blumenthal (<a href="http://www.thedrum.com/news/2013/05/29/we-are-scratching-surface-multi-sensory-world-heston-blumenthal-art-storytelling">1</a>, <a href="http://www.huhmagazine.co.uk/3420/heston-blumenthals-multi-sensory-animation">2</a>)
And by the artist <a href="http://www.miriamsimun.com/ghostfood/">Miriam Simun</a></p>

<p>I’ve decided to combine the facts I learned from the above readings with a show.
For this magic I used 3 pairs of wooden chopsticks, 3 small plates, 1 strawberry and a knife
<img src="/img/taste/magic.jpg" alt="magic set up" /></p>

<p>When showing the magic, I asked a volunteer from the audience to cut the strawberry into 3 equal pieces and put one piece in each plate.
Than, the audience member was asked to eat the first (left most) piece of strawberry and describe it’s taste.
I then did a “magic movement” above the second strawberry. Now the second piece should taste differently from the first one. even though it was the same strawberry! and a different taste for the third piece as well.
The magic performed in class did not work well as I expected (worked better when I tested this on my office mates) but the third strawberry piece did tasted a little different (according to my volunteer).</p>

<p>The trick was adding different scents to the chopsticks. When holding the scented chopstick near the nose the smell has an effect on the way taste feels.
